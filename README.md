# MEAN Shopping List

This is a shopping list app implemented using the MEAN stack. It allows list items to be categorized and sorted by category, and lists can be shared with other users. It consists of an Node/Express JSON API backed by MongoDB, and an AngularJS frontend. WebSockets are used to persist data in realtime. It is hosted [here](http://agile-lowlands-40380.herokuapp.com).

This is not a finished product. It works well enough in its current form, but several features were never finished and the code needs to be cleaned up a bit.
